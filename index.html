                        I'm a recent Queen's University graduate with a degree in Computer Science, specializing in game development. I have strong experience using Unity/Unreal to create PC and mobile games with complex mechanics, intuitive controls, and optimized performance.
                        My work includes integrating Steamworks API for achievements, and contributing to audio and promotional materials. I'm passionate about creating innovative games, with titles available on Steam and Google Play.
                        I'm also a fan of gaming, music, and anime, drawing inspiration from series like One Piece and JRPGs like Final Fantasy.

                                A novel fast-paced stealth game, where you play as a Snowman whose goal is to successfully toss snowballs at every child in the game before you melt away.
                                To introduce the element of quick thinking, we created the 'Snowman Melting Mechanic' which limits how long a player can operate before they must replenish their 'Snow levels'.
                                This encourages quick thinking and skilled reactions, as well as providing a risk and reward mechanic as the game ends if you run out of snow.
