                            <p>
                                A novel fast-paced stealth game, where you play as a Snowman whose goal is to successfully toss snowballs at every child in the game before you melt away.
                                To introduce the element of quick thinking, we created the 'Snowman Melting Mechanic' which limits how long a player can operate before they must replenish their 'Snow levels'.
                                This encourages quick thinking and skilled reactions, as well as providing a risk and reward mechanic as the game ends if you run out of snow.
                                This was a group project created at Queens University for CISC 226.
